Makefile usage:
---------------
make run: creates the .class file and executes the AlgorithmSimulator.java file to show the output.
make clean: removes the .class files


This assignment implements three CPU schedule algorithms
1) FCFS
	a)FCFS.java (FCFS implemented)
	b)FirstCome.java (Comparator function)
	c)ProcessFCFS.java (Process class)
2) SJF (Shortest job first)
	a)ShortestJob.java (Comparator function)
	b)SJF.java   (SJF implemented)
3) Round-Robin Scheduling
	a)RoundRobin.java  (RoundRobin implemented)
	b)ProcessRobin.java  (Process class)
	c)RoundRobinComp.java  (Comparator function)


AlgorithmSimulator.java:
This file is the simulator for running all the algorithms at once.Mainly we have to run this file.
